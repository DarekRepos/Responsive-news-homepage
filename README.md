## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vite
- BEM
- Sass
- use mobile first approach

### What I learned

I implemented a modern web design using a combination of cutting-edge techniques and best practices. Leveraging Semantic HTML5 markup, I ensured that the structure of the webpage was clear and accessible, prioritizing content hierarchy and user experience.

To style the elements, I utilized CSS custom properties, enabling easy maintenance and flexibility throughout the project. Employing Flexbox and CSS Grid allowed me to create dynamic layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, following a mobile-first workflow to ensure optimal performance on smaller screens.

Thanks to Vite, a lightning-fast build tool, I was able to streamline my development process, significantly reducing build times and enhancing productivity. Implementing the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology helped maintain a scalable and modular codebase, facilitating collaboration and future updates.

Additionally, I incorporated Sass for advanced CSS authoring, taking advantage of features like variables, mixins, and nesting to write cleaner and more maintainable stylesheets. Embracing a mobile-first approach throughout the project ensured that the website was optimized for mobile devices from the outset, delivering a seamless experience across all platforms.

Overall, this project not only allowed me to apply a diverse range of web development skills but also reinforced the importance of staying up-to-date with industry trends and best practices to deliver high-quality, responsive web solutions.


### Continued development

I'm proud to have achieved flexible and responsive layouts. Deploying the page to GitHub Pages presented the biggest challenge, but I learned a lot from troubleshooting the issues. Building the responsive menu was another hurdle, as it involved combining various HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements. Moving forward, I'm eager to focus on accessibility, enhance my JavaScript skills, and explore Sass for more efficient styling.
